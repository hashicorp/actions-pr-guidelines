| ------------  | ------------------  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Praise 🙌     | `:raised_hands:`    | Use to highlight something positive. It's nice to try to leave one per review, but don't leave false praise just to leave one of these comments.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Question 🙋   | `:raising_hand:`    | Use to gain clarity from the code author. The conversation could evolve into any one of these other categories. Only the reviewer should resolve these comment threads.                                                                                                                                       |
| Thought 💭    | `:thought_balloon:` | Use to share context, leave a breadcrumb, or share an idea that came up while reviewing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Blocker 🚧    | `:construction:`    | Use to request changes that block merging the current PR. Only the reviewer should resolve these comment threads.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Future 📌     | `:pushpin:`         | Use to request changes that the code author can choose to address in the current PR or a follow-up one.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bookmark🔖    | `:bookmark:`        | Use to request changes that may require substantial changes/improvements that cannot be completed within a reasonable timeframe and can be bookmarked for later. The code author/reviewer must create a JIRA ticket to table for the future that includes context and point-of-contacts to circle back on.    |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                             |
| Optional 🎨   | `:art:`             | Use to suggest optional changes that you feel strongly about but ultimately defer to the code author to make a decision on. These can be comments that turn into valuable conversation starters for adopting new code styles, guidelines, or team practices.                                                  |
| Nitpick ⛏️    | `:pick:`            | Use to suggest changes based on loose opinions or personal preferences. The difference between this and **Optional** 🎨  is how strong the code reviewer's opinion is.                                                                                                                                        |
